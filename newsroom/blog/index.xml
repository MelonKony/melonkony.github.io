      <description>The Epoch of Rest We’ve spent a lot of time in the 21st century — but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let’s enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.
By 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on.</description>

      <description>Station Dogs I’m starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.
Vekllei National Railways, or ‘VK Rail’ was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics.</description>

Look at the stars
抬头仰望满天繁星
Look how they shine for you
看它们为你绽放着 闪烁不息
And everything you do
而你的一颦一举
Yeah&amp;rsquo; they were all Yellow
却满含胆怯和羞意
I came along
我追随着你的气息
I wrote a song for you
为你写下一首歌曲
And all the things you do
回想着你的所有举动和笑意
it was called Yellow
并用Yellow为这首歌命名
So then I took my turn
我耗尽心力
Oh what a thing to have done
用行动表达我的爱意
And it was all Yellow
噢这过程充满不安羞怯和点滴暖意
