									<h2>1.1 Participatory Economics in Utopia</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p><strong>Vekllei does not use money.</strong> To some extent, that statement summarises the core of the idea. Just as the abstract and mercantile economies of the United States are far removed from these shores, so too are the utopian ideas of Morris and More with all such romanticism and glory of immercantile society. The whole Vekllei system is perhaps better summed up as a thoroughly uncommodified society as opposed to a simply ‘cashless’ one; for the real material consequence of the absence of money is not in its transitory symbolism as a moneyless utopia but in how Vekllei people have come to approach domestic postindustrial life.</p>
											<p>The economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei’s history, landscape and culture.</p>
											<p>The core principles of Vekllei’s parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:</p>
											<ol>
													<li>Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.</li>
													<li>Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.</li>
													<li>Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes.</li>
													<li>Participatory employment.</li>
													<li>Economic feminisation.</li>
											</ol>
											<p>Most unusual is Vekllei’s cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether — a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‘ownership’.</p>
											<p>Yes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) — but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:</p>

												<li>Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth — 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community.</li>
												<li>Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‘garden city’ design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism.</li>
												<li>Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous.</li>
												<li>The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics.</li>
												<li>Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung  — essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.</p>

									<h2>1.2 Petticoat Socialism</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<div class="box">
												<p>As a second introduction, it is important to preface the following economic facts about the country with the context of the culture we are dealing with. Petticoat socialism is not a construced, secular ideology — it comes from a place of history, tradition, and environmental circumstance unique to Vekllei and her people. It would be impossible to replicate in other modern societies because of the simple fact that other societies are not Vekllei. Petticoat society is predicated not just on council municipalism or product socialism, but newda architecture (in principles of dumousiantopet), spiritualist feminism (economic feminism or lolasouveitet), self-worship (found in upen), etc. The economy is a product of preexisting society, not the other way around. The cathedral of ideology, and her accompanying carousel of instinct, are unique to the lived experiences and consequential generational culture of Vekllei people. That is not to say there is no value in analysing Vekllei’s systems of production and distribution — the country has been a delight of long-abashed anarchists even before post-scarcity — just that Vekllei people do not consider their economies and cultures distinct, and so petticoat society remains a privilege of this island country.</p>
											</div>
											<p>Identified officially as ‘<i>petticoat socialism</i>’, the namesake of the Vekllei economy is self-congratulatory and essentially meaningless. While superficially her system adheres to a socialist premise — a stateless, classless society in which the economic organs are owned by the people that work them — applying the namesake haphazardly is an avenue of thought that neglects the reality of modern Vekllei economics. For example, while it is true that Vekllei people do not recognise private property (in a Marxist use of the word), it is also true that they do not recognise public property either, or the concept of the thing altogether. The country is not entirely communal — there is implied ownership of grocer’s shops by grocers, and restaurants by chefs, but ownership or lack thereof is not codified in law.</p>

												<p>Vekllei instead recognises two types of business, which one might consider property. There is <i>venrouiva</i>: administrative, governmental and national facilities of essential function. Technically speaking, anything under command of the bodies that form national direction (government, legislature, judiciary, etc.) are part of the <i>venrouiva</i>. This is similar to what we consider nationalised institutions in our countries, but also includes essential industries like electricity and education. This is distinct from <i>senrouive</i>: as private or personal business. It is not the same as ‘private’ property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property — everything belongs to the natural landscape, including the city-state itself. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is <i>senrouive</i>. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.</p>
												<p>The basic domestic economy is not regulated except in theory, and not measured except as a statistical curiosity.</p>

									<h2>1.3 Participatory Economics & Property</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>In Vekllei’s feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of Upen brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following the first Atomic War. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages — the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as <i>Sundress Municipalism</i>. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.</p>
											<p>The old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived — the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.</p>
											<p>The foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society — disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.</p>
											<p>The ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward — the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>The ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‘folk morality’; a phenomena largely dependent on the person’s social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership — indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about <i>senrouive</i> business ownership — but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage — the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‘blood rights’ ( similar to ‘folk morality’) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.</p>
											<p>Herein remains the distinction between <i>venrouiva/senrouive</i> property, and their implied ownership. <i>Venrouiva</i> usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. <i>Senrouive</i> exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), <i>senrouive</i> will almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.</p>
											<p>Because of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless — Indeed, <i>venrouiva</i> are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from <i>senrouive</i> work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even <i>senrouive</i> business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of <i>venrouiva</i> and <i>senrouive</i> workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.</p>
