									<h2>Schools in a Society Without Children</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p><strong>When you get into the idea of it, “The Child” is a particularly unfortunate projection.</strong> It’s not something most would agree with, but that’s how it’s worked out in the late 2070s. In fact, critical foundations of how foreigners view the world are not culturally neutral subjects as they might assume, timeless and naturally occurring, but are in fact symptoms of ideology. And despite the fact that there are children everywhere, The Child as an independent category of human being is a recent invention, informed by modernism.</p>
											<p>If you visit Vekllei, and pay enough attention to the ordinary routines of the common Vekllei person, you too might be struck by the absence of The Child.</p>
											<p>This is the Montre-Lola-Yuman School, but is usually recalled as its district number: Montre 6th. Although modestly pretty, situated in a misty valley and constructed in the postwar demonewda style (a literal portmanteau of education, or demolan, and Vekllei modernism, or newda), it is the site of a remarkable clash between old and new.</p>
											<p>People live simpler lives here. Smaller lives, too, focused on pleasure and its pursuit. They have less to hide, and so less to hide from their own children. Here, a kid discovers a great deal about the basic premises of life and navigating relationships from watching their parents go about their work and conversations, and learn largely through play and interaction. Older siblings take on adult, independent roles within the family whilst the United States and Europe further complexify The Child into atomised subcategories; teen-agers, pre-teens, toddlers, and so on. In Vekllei, media and products designed for The Child are uncommon, as are clothes designed for Children, and so growth is informed through exploration and observation, rather than their age and year of schooling.</p>
											<p>The changes are small but shift mountains culturally. It is not simply that children are “small adults,” or that they are ignored or not given affection, but that the grotesque commodification of childhood has been abolished with commodity itself. The very nature of childhood, then, is different from how foreigners understand The Child. In Vekllei, children mix freely between age groups, and do not subconsciously recognise stages of development in a matter of years. They attend the same school for the entire length of their mandatory schooling. Uniforms are universal and carry all the way through university. By their early teen-age years, the young Vekllei person is ready to carry out their place in paradise. This affords the youth of Vekllei dignity and responsibility, and forces a reconsideration of identity outside of the generic expectation of that age group.</p>
											<p>Now, modernism does not necessarily mean commoditisation — but they're almost always found sleeping in the same bed. There is no scandal here. From the supermarkets of Utah to the villages of Uraguay, modern ideas of The Child and Interiority have warped the human brain unconsciously, rendering the whole world a meaningless scaffold of incestuous constructions — with a cultural history buried in copies of copies of copies. The way we understand landscape, the Self, our children, are all missing or altered in Vekllei, a modernist society without modernism. The rest of the world has been this way for centuries — and, most devastatingly, as soon as these constructions were 'discovered,' their origins as constructions were suppressed. It seems to have always been this way, even though it was an invention that coincided more or less with the steam engine. The Child is no more inherent to “nature” (itself a construction) than a railway locomotive.</p>

											<p>Thus, over the course of several centuries in the Western world, the child was discovered. Once it was found, an epistemological constellation had to be erected around it to make use of it. To write a story or paint a picture, The Child is projected. A child of America today will now wear clothes for children, play with toys for children and consume media built for that age group. You can expect a child to go through distinct phases, quantified numerically through their years of modern schooling. This carries on to poison the entire lens of childhood, and indeed, the subsumption of the outside world into this sort of culture and commodity is shocking to the Vekllei tourist.</p>
											<p>This unusual fact makes Vekllei unique in the ideological landscape today, at once a pioneer of the arts and industry and a pre-industrial village, free from the ideological misery of modern life. The abolishment of industry, and the rising up of all people, has rendered the Vekllei people not classless, but a single enourmous class — an intellectual, educated class. What truly makes them unique, however, is how the “old ways” and “rural priority” are alive and well in the cities and apartments of the modern Vekllei person. That is utopia in Vekllei today, and that is what it means to grow up there.</p>

									<h2>A look at a Vekllei timetable</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>Most students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents. These days might occur sequentially or be scattered throughout the week, but most common is a Monday-Wednesday table table of four hours a day.</p>
											<p>Tzipora, whose previous schooling was in a Catholic school in California, struggled to make sense of her timetable at first. The Vekllei curriculum very quickly depreciates courses outside of the interest of the student, and so staples of modern Western education — science, history, mathematics, language, were jumbled and in some cases dropped altogether.</p>

											<h4>Let’s break down her timetable, illustrated partially in English for your convenience.</h4>

											<dl>
												<dt>Mathematics</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>Zelda struggles with even basic maths, and so she retains a course for her own wellbeing. Mandatory curriculum maths in Vekllei is mostly pragmatic and straightforward, and teaches theory as well as the basics of calculation and operations. More abstract maths like algebra and calculus are generally only taught in advanced classes designed to facilitate interest in those who show promise in it. Zelda is not one of them.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>Language</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>Zelda is an immigrant and at this point in her life speaks only primitive, conversational Vekllei. Because of this, she has three hours of class time a week but attends a special class for tutoring after school each day. She also makes use of her own time to study Vekllei logographs, called Topet. Baron is a good help because she can practice conversationally with him without the shame of mangling language in the real world.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>Ideology</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>Zelda for the first time in her life is beginning to engage with the world as a global network, and is quickly learning geography and flags to illustrate it in her mind. The Ideology class is concerned with worldview and how social structures influence it. It looks at traditional political ideologies as well as unconscious assumptions, and how those things affect policy and geopolitics.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>Chemistry</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>Zelda likes chemistry and has good grades in it, and so she’s testing her ability in that area. Although she’s clearly developed an aptitude for the arts and language, she’s young enough to doubt her place and still enjoys experimenting with disciplines outside her expertise.</p>
												</dd>

												<dl>
													<dt>Sewing</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Zelda likes sewing, and it helps her feel useful since she’s largely dependent on others for most other parts of her life. This class teaches young Vekllei people practical skills for maintaining clothes in the household. Next year, she plans to take on a more rigorous maintenance course to varnish wood and caulk windows, since it takes forever to get a contractor up to their apartment.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Illustration</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Zelda does not have enough of an ego to be intimidated by the skills of those around her, so she enjoys the class as a therapeutic outlet for her boundless creative impulses. She is trying to learn to draw portraits so she can do one of Baron for Christmas.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Club time</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Zelda belongs to the news club of Lola 7th School, and works on weekends as a photographer for the weekly newsletter. Her colleagues are polite and ambitious, and they appreciate her desire to learn. On school time she mostly meets with other members to help print the newsletter by hand on the old jobber press, and develop her photos in the school’s dark lab.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Society</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Zelda learns Vekllei history and values in this class, which helps explain everything from the intricacies of the Bureau System and Sundress Municipalism to more intimate notions of the proper way to wear a quarter-pleat and semoisnesne (sun-facing attitude). It also helps contrast Vekllei’s system against the rest of the world, and more explicitly outlines Vekllei’s place in it.</p>
													</dd>
												</dl>
												<p>Although Tzipora would have many troubles with school, none of them were ever related to her enthusiasm for her classes. Since she picked the ones that benefited her and had plenty of time off to explore the skills learned in them, she developed a healthy curiosity for her talents and it was reflected well in her grades. But, as most Vekllei students will tell you, they learn just as much growing up outside of school as they do inside the classroom. She would not have it any other way.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<h2>School Uniform and Ideology</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>Life in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a variety of historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits. Where a uniform might be employed for economic reasons in a country of poverty, or as a form of social control in schools, in Vekllei they are identifiers and champions of labour in a workplace or school.</p>
											<p>For the students of Vekllei, a single uniform is distributed across all ages of schooling, from preschool right through university and miscellaneous higher education. For girls, it is highly modular and incorporates important cultural items of clothing, like the <strong>gi</strong> quarter-pleat, <strong>temple</strong> and <strong>fountain</strong> hairpieces, and overskirt lace aprons called sun petticoats (in ceremony). Although Vekllei was once cold year-round, today it sees warm summers and mild winters that encourage distinct summer and winter fashions. A girl’s preference in uniforms may cycle through many styles over her schooling years, from spartan minimalism in high school (of just an armband, white shirt and red skirt) to decadent ceremony in her university years.</p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CpIMghBmqB9HzRzbd4w7EI-xCFiZgWy-TZ8RP5wVkn-isGfFl_cDMaTGSoR3l8TJLthz9kMGBl_tl8v0JRyLfGYm5ji_cO1IMVnbxvzI5qCU9XaFPRwygvp5ffLZrEQRY7N9_GkomOxTvDVnEUl71x_UYsg4gCbJQ3NJcgeub1JwLI3DvVii1zq86oJo5jn_L12S_Ci0fV9NFPE5cU702rH3OC4vJU2vFaEDxOECaz4Fe31ED9JHtYT5MSmUJSFCgCbwU4Epql3Oe1AD-YD8DYqIt_FQIZkebF4ujBVxXpsETdxzr6yjCo-jf-5gtmNw4Z1TSUrZH_0fuIp_C9k2euCXCzdcaouMUgCmjBBbJe34gYUqpy5Zr_JDRSyMXeBSyh18R0eO1WYLH0zlrEDFS3I1pQ5z6ssl749395oZUrrETNjm4p4htbEME79mM_wIVoq7E-I3V2wpzovm9_w6U9vq-77LmF8Am9BBZZxiKrQehLzdQbtB4drFuDIMaSt_4s0xvVy7HkAJ9275YfRRdA2qtjObwbBA_r-T1W-2Ryuhw5RPE17nV8uDnhUZ4tuQ4LBuPb6C8jouDConRrd1HpzdWuf3fD_JMggbs0DxGgCeSothPWClB-PS4igYu9TNvbUw7O4_iKmS_04Xwc5fE7Qx3QAkHAYJm13KpLfL_qSbGXZKjOVepnqP=s1476-no" alt="" /></span>
											<p>In Vekllei Semaphore, the language of colour and shape, red and white imply both youth and energy (as well as sweetness, determinedness and purity depending on the context), and are often recognised as the national colours. In youth, it distinguishes education from traditional labour (in the literal, physical sense), which is communicated with navy blue.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5lvMLFWHQhzP5egU3YQH7w1b0Mo3S1xw1xtjX5xB1BeGkDN_WRFZegYz-_dqYh7SK2HTYtRLvwIZCGNvgADb1N0YX6unnmw1qYZ2ZSj_2RtwqWYvvflCxgPqgYmWS4QwgT9QNGgaHtc3YCrFLGz2OvGCae6XVLpjvX7DN-bxx3_nlH89IAwyI668Q50VCM2kZS3SuV-lnN1H91biRvnWcch_J57kT5pgDrhDUtRrk1QTQNBII2L6xg8ksWbYnK-J6wJiqhWL63hsAA2ZlTHb1O3zn7O6ParjUSKdqGTTE9ga0cY109QbC4_3KViFluUp10WTSuDNLkJjeUs3n_31H10oEijxy3zeAsqRA6X1soVae9a8WoJZYRuicBp2ppVZv1_O6LmrH9ige18uj2KlQa289IGZOiM9_i6i1v_GrpC9loysxfN9PAHOYCc5GwzB0zYM8xsm1CLvnORF3itFhTNzDNADRf_FsM_R_sD_Dh5zqXSRLphxlfexlXjrj6pKpZJ58JurBIGUDSkkDqu8RvXciLmKWqJ5JhDuVVVkMLp8pwq6YVCjGBkR1TLQ87RWGmecxCA6ZiRBChz_tL9uvQJ9-aQn0UdkMwv8gjpyuhb1uIDFFZB0nkUyDf_4Ddqbmr3BVaNxmHaIDchYlXyu9QffK6PX-pa9f-hioOpp1D_eu3D1o-c8djh1=s1476-no" alt="" /></span>
											<p>High-quality uniforms are a marker of national pride, as indicators of national wealth after the shameful poverty of the First Atomic War’s fallout. To the people of Vekllei, an intricate and expensive uniform distributed amongst ordinary people greatly influences the national ego, and further contributes to Vekllei’s social and cultural isolation from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
											<p>Compared to their girls, who are adorned with many layers of clothing and dazzling patterns, the schoolboys of Vekllei are unadorned. Lace and quarter-pleats give way to bolder forms and masculine colours.</p>
											<p>As much of Vekllei’s uniform ideology straddles complex (and often precipitous) schisms of modern and traditional clothing items, boys have received considerably more progressive attention than their sisters. They sport jackets of synthetic materials where girls favour wool and cotton, but do not enjoy the same modularity or flexibility in style.</p>
											<p>Visible here are the standard armbands universal to Vekllei life, a male tie (although only male in an education context, and is often appropriated by rebellious young women), and a captain’s plate to distinguish certain older students as club leaders, which are integral parts of the Vekllei schooling experience. Clubs operate independently of the school and often assist students in honing their expertise for higher education.</p>

									<h2>An introduction to Youth Orgs</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a “helter skelter” decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.</p>
											<p>It wasn’t just a crisis of resources — there had been Taiwan, and the Commonwealth Wars, and the disaster of decolonisation. There was a long history of decline, paved in blood, and it was pretty clear that things were going to get worse before they got better. If they got better at all.</p>
											<p>In Winter 2064, several clauses were introduced into BSA recruitment that would reposition the organisation as a fundamentally patriotic youth org, and would seek to raise a generation of the kinds of boys and girls America would need in the coming decades. They would have to be resourceful, capable and most of all, dutiful adults.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Rlf_sKeJ6Xf3UWyp5iL9gHQXP0J_NWGFO8H1zFwy7egncmoM2naFhOWcM2XIr3ZvyOiY351aOJvZ8vrP5fG2_uUwHnqDFQRMU-Ov95a4m0ZFYkoaStTyNRJRZ4OmT_RMey_28cteLhjnI2kb47NDT4JHmjbmek58l5Y8PfiC4OcKPOYQ8NxkaEqx4mcSFN8DpabrX2DeGPaQSfzZq4Ndgn3NjEeOYcjugeIAgQ8NPIicG-xcKuDG3OI7o7oVPC1ph2NnktDtiEso73LwcW2-l1XBgaYl4LzifLMMG8euE6rEeiBOotk-veOZ65ABkSYApoFNkUL3euEHma_yapp5XkvI9XSYEuX69y26G277ztjFE9mLPc5S0N9_OLOWZGKdbcMFz4iySOR0LDUtoKlk8_BXD1BEo6r-9dNlHBxtVg7AZ_7nd_1rFbJyjTYKHXZBrQ73xiePH69Dn6PIqqvpailrFyVlIR9FggI_v7EoJ7dmAED8WCz_xhAS_pjJ2YK50sfDHM6b5QvsWu1ut14Bqo-BtolniT8r2qLBNK7EwtrntpMtaV7nX2rcawRgnXAwFPtuYLUILxJP6No3sjV2ElWDAaK6leWRiy-G218uQYLgqSIhW25PkO1Umv1HxyW4HekQUI8JFZ_JamWuTTejBF1aS1jF_wUyiqfQio_bjaOpCNEp3QBSHyJd=s1476-no" alt="" /></span>
										</div>
									<p> Chinese-born children were thereafter denied entry altogether, and those of immigrant heritage would be subject to allegiance testing. Over the course of a week and several indiscreet searches of the family political history, the BSA recruitment board would weed out communists and suspected agitators.</p>
									<p> For an organisation of the prestige and heritage of the BSA to implement overt racial vetting meant that political repression was normalised — so-called “national orthodoxy” — in youth orgs around the world.</p>
									<p>In Vekllei the largest youth organisations include</p>
									<ol>
										<li>The National Blossoms</li>
										<li>The Puffin Scouts</li>
										<li>The Landscape Bureau</li>
									</ol>
									<p>The <strong>National Blossoms</strong> concern themselves largely with traditional landcare and stewardship of national parks, and the <strong>Puffin Scouts</strong> are focussed on camping and friendship. The <strong>Landscape Bureau</strong> includes people of all ages, not just youth, and form part of Vekllei’s Parks and Heritage organisation (in which careers can be forged).
									<p>Although the constitutional reforms of the BSA, and subsequent militarisation of many European scouting organisations (as well as several so-called Western pockets of Asia), had little obvious effect on Vekllei’s youth orgs, subtle changes were made to better distinguish her domestic scouts from the rise of child fascism across the world. Parts of the uniform were demilitarised, and girls were allowed to wear skirts for the first time. The colours of the Puffin Scouts shifted from red and white, which is associated with the country as an identity, to gold and green, which better translate to “wilderness” in Vekllei Semaphore. The political curriculum of the youth orgs (covering Upen, the Bureau System and the modern Vekllei city-state) was shifted to eighteen and above.</p>
									<p>It’s a scary time to be alive, but the children of Vekllei’s youth orgs are largely unaware of it outside of nuclear drills. Young scouts — ranked as Pufflings in the Puffin Scouts — spend their childhood years learning to tie knots and make friends, where the children of America are learning to shoot a rifle and memorise the dual constitutions; that of the Boy Scouts, and that of America.</p>
