    <p>Vekllei does not use money. To some extent, that statement summarises the core of the idea. Just as the abstract and mercantile economies of the United States are far removed from these shores, so too are the utopian ideas of Morris and More with all such romanticism and glory of immercantile society. The whole Vekllei system is perhaps better summed up as a thoroughly uncommodified society as opposed to a simply ‘cashless’ one; for the real material consequence of the absence of money is not in its transitory symbolism as a moneyless utopia but in how Vekllei people have come to approach domestic postindustrial life.</p>
<p>The economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei’s history, landscape and culture.</p>

    <p>The core principles of Vekllei’s parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:</p>
<p>Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.
Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.
Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes.
Participatory employment.
Economic feminisation.
Most unusual is Vekllei’s cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether — a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‘ownership’.</p>
<p>Yes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) — but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:</p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
    <ul>
<li>Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth — 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community.</li>
<li>Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‘garden city’ design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism.</li>
<li>Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous.
The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics.</li>
<li>Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung  — essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.
